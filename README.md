# Launching Your Airbnb Clone: A Complete Guide

Airbnb started in 2008 as a simple idea: let people rent out extra space in their homes to travelers. Today, it‚Äôs a global platform connecting millions of guests with hosts offering unique stays-from apartments to villas, treehouses, and even tiny homes.
